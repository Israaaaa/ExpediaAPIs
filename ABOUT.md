### About this assignment

I was aiming for a user-friendly, and easy to use web site for the users. I focused on the display of the results and directed the users to complete their booking process (so not only search.)
I had to prior experience with the language I used (PHP), so I would say what I learned with this is how to use PHP to build a simple web site, that calls an API and returns the results, and display them in a nice matter by dynamicly building the listing.
