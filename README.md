* What you need to setup this website locally:
1- PHP
2- Server such as Apache
3- git clone https://github.com/Israaaaa/ExpediaAPIs.git
3- After running the server, and cloning the project, visit /ExpediaAPIs/index.php to start testing the website

* Concerning issues with the APIs:
1- destinationName parameter provided in the assignment does not return any results, so I had to use destination parameter instead.
2- Choosing maxStarRating parameter and setting it to 1 returns more results than the results without setting any filter param.
