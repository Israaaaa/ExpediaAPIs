* What you need to setup this website locally:
<br>
1- PHP
<br>
2- Server such as Apache
<br>
3- git clone https://github.com/Israaaaa/ExpediaAPIs.git
<br>
4- After running the server, and cloning the project, visit /ExpediaAPIs/index.php to start testing the website
<br><br>
* Concerning issues with the APIs:
<br>
1- destinationName parameter provided in the assignment does not return any results, so I had to use destination parameter instead.
<br>
2- Choosing maxStarRating parameter and setting it to 1 returns more results than the results without setting any filter param.
